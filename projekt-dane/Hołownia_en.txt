Hołownia’s Election Program 2025 – A Program for People!
Come with me! Together, we will change Poland into a better place to live. A country where people are the most important.
Let’s build a safe and welcoming Poland together. A strong and honest Poland. A prosperous and compassionate Poland. A modern and united Poland under the white-and-red flag. The Poland of our dreams, our potential, and our skills. A Poland that is good for us and for our children.
Join me. Support the campaign. And vote for me!
Development for Poland People in Cieszyn, Kutno, Hajnówka, and Mielec are just as important as those in Warsaw and Gdańsk. It’s time to focus on the development of Poland outside of the metropolises.
Cheap electricity from Polish sun and wind The development of renewable energy sources (RES), energy storage, and nuclear energy. Polish forests for people, not for power plants.
Affordable housing Social housing for people, instead of special privileges for developers. Loans with normal margins, instead of a paradise for banks.
Polish armaments for the Polish economy Half of the defense spending directed to Polish businesses. Defense spending as a driving force of the Polish economy.
Security Poland as a leader in the Baltic Sea region and a strong element of European security.
Poland in 100 minutes The possibility to travel within 100 minutes from any village to the regional capital. Rail and public transport for everyone, not just large cities.
State-owned companies to be fixed No more party appointees. The assets of Poles in the hands of professionals.
Smartphones out of schools Primary schools without phones. A healthy childhood without violence and technology addiction.
