Prosperity – More Money in Poles’ Pockets
VAT cut to 22 % On my first day in office, August 6, 2025, I will submit a bill lowering the standard VAT rate from 23 % to 22 %.
Lower, pro-family taxes
0 % PIT for families with two or more children
Second tax threshold raised to PLN 140 000
Abolition of the “Belka tax” on capital gains
Simple business taxes
Pro-family reliefs for entrepreneurs
Investment-friendly property tax
Single payment—one easy return covering PIT, ZUS and health contributions
No new tax hikes Constitutional protection against a property-tax (“cadastral”) or inheritance tax; I will not sign any tax increase for ordinary Poles.
Cheap electricity—bills 33 % lower Green certificates to offset household bills instead of subsidizing electric cars; affordable coal power—mine it, extract it, develop it.
Patient Service Center End the chaos in healthcare: one point to register, reschedule, find a doctor, and shorten waiting lists.
Respectful pension uprating Pension increases of at least PLN 150 per month—and always above inflation.

A Normal State – Poles Always First
Poland First! The Polish state must care primarily for its citizens. Poles have priority access to social services, healthcare, and education.
Stop the Green Deal Poland must withdraw from the Green Deal and recover its costs for ordinary Poles.
A safe childhood free of ideology Halt proposals for easy gender change for minors; no adoption by same-sex couples; no ideology in schools.
A strong Polish school Quality education—keep homework, foster real relationships; smartphones banned; protect children and support parents; teaching is a profession of trust and respect.
Equal before the law, courts worthy of trust End the chaos in the judiciary. Every Pole deserves a fair, objective, apolitical court—stability, digitization, faster case resolution. If no cross-party consensus on reform emerges, Poles must decide in a referendum.

A Secure Poland in Reliable Alliances
Stop the Migration Pact Withdraw from the Global Migration Compact; introduce safeguards against illegal immigration.
Security above divisions A Polish Security Constitution. Poland as fortress of the eastern flank—5 % of GDP on defence, 300 000 trained soldiers; accelerate armaments and volunteer training; strong in NATO; Polish troops will not be sent to Ukraine.
Effective civil defence A new crisis-management system in every commune led by the State Fire Service, with 100 % grants for each commune to build shelters and safety systems.

Development for Poland’s Future!
The Big Four of Development CPK (Central Transport Hub), nuclear power, port modernization, investment zones—an ambitious infrastructure programme guaranteeing a prosperous future for Poles.
Everyday investments A local-investment programme in every commune: new roads, water and sewage systems, internet access and network expansion, school renovations, bike paths—contracts for Polish companies and jobs for Poles everywhere.
Support farmers, care for the Polish countryside No to dismantling Polish agriculture—no Mercosur deal, no cuts to the EU agricultural budget, no Green Deal in farming, no “chain law,” no uncontrolled inflow of Ukrainian food. Polish land in Polish hands.
Polish zloty! No to the euro Rash euro adoption means higher prices and dependence on EU elites. Yes to economic freedom—keep cash.
Finally, our own “M”! Land for cooperative and municipal housing; state support for purchasing a first home; limit unfair bank profits on mortgage interest—benefiting Poles, not developers or banks allied with the authorities.
Fund for breakthrough technologies At least PLN 5 billion annually to develop secure breakthrough technologies: AI, quantum computing, biotech, and drug manufacturing.

Low, Simple, Pro-Family Taxes – The Tax Contract
No to tax hikes I will not sign any law raising taxes for Poles!
VAT cut to 22 % On August 6, 2025, I will file a bill to lower the standard VAT rate from 23 % to 22 %.
“Lower and Pro-Family Taxes” package (also filed on August 6, 2025):
0 % PIT for families with two or more children—exemption up to PLN 140 000 of annual income per parent for those raising at least two dependents (minors, persons with disabilities, or students up to age 25).
Pro-family reliefs extended to entrepreneurs paying the 19 % flat tax or the registered-revenue lump sum.
Second tax threshold raised to PLN 140 000.
Abolition of the “Belka tax” on capital gains up to PLN 140 000 of income per year.
Fair pension uprating: at least PLN 150 and always above the inflation rate.
Constitutional protection against a property tax I will propose amending the Constitution to ban any cadastral tax on homes owned by Polish families.
Constitutional guarantee of tax-free inheritance I will propose enshrining in the Constitution the right to inherit wealth across generations without tax.
“Budget Armour” – Protecting public finances I will submit the “Budget Armour” bill to shield the state budget from abuse. This will crack down on VAT-fraud mafias and other schemes defrauding public funds. According to the latest data from the National Tax Administration, tax revenues have plummeted again after eight years, and KAS warns Poland faces a fiscal crisis if this continues—so we must act now!
