‘The Republic of Poland is a democratic state governed by the rule of law, realizing the principles of social justice’: these words – Article 2 of the Polish Constitution – define the vision of my presidency.
I want a democratic and secular Poland. A state founded on the rule of law. I will strive to end the constitutional chaos. I want to put into practice the constitutional principle of social justice and actively combat income inequality. I want dynamic and responsible development and the building of the Polish economy. I want national security – both on the military level, in international cooperation, and in the everyday safety of millions of Polish women and men.
PROSPERITY. My approach to the economy is based on recognizing the role of the market – but a market in which the state plays an active role. It protects the weak from poverty and the abuses of the strong, creates simple and fair regulations, and fights pathological practices. I will defend workers’ rights, support measures to improve the working conditions of those employed in the public sector, introduce genuine progressive taxation (also for businesses), and rely more than ever on direct taxes. As President, I will veto laws that harm workers and increase social inequalities.
Poles are among the hardest-working nations in Europe. They deserve good wages, affordable housing, and access to efficient public services, regardless of where they live. That is in all our interests. In conflicts with market giants, I will stand with ordinary people, which is why I will work to reduce bank loan installments and ensure fair relations between citizens and banks.
DEVELOPMENT. Long-term thinking about improving the quality of life for the citizens of Poland requires responsible economic planning. The days when Poland was the poor cousin of the West are long gone. We are a strong economy in the heart of Europe. In recent decades we were a growth leader, but our level of investment and innovation remains too low. I will make sure that changes. We can afford flagship investments – high-speed rail, nuclear power plants, modern energy grids, and renewables – which will become the economy’s flywheel and guarantee a development leap for Poland. We can afford to develop artificial intelligence (AI) and other emerging technologies. We can ensure that they help create new jobs. AI is the technology that will define the real power of states in the 21st century. The potential of Polish scientists opens up a great opportunity for Poland’s civilizational advancement.
I will also ensure increased private-sector investment. State institutions must cooperate with businesses and universities in this regard, setting strategic goals and sparing no resources for their realization – so that investments build the country’s future rather than rely on financial speculation.
SECURITY. One of the president’s basic tasks is to protect the security of the state. Security must be understood broadly. On a personal level, security is freedom from poverty, a roof over one’s head, and access to doctors.
At the state level, security is resilience to the challenges posed by the modern world. I want Poland to be prepared for the climate crisis. We need an energy transition that ensures Poland’s energy sovereignty and gives Poles affordable electricity. It is time to actively fight drought, safeguard the environment and water resources, and ensure food security that provides us with healthy and safe food. Finally, it means a strong, well-organized, and misinformation-resistant society, efficient public institutions, and the protection of critical infrastructure (against both physical and cyber attacks). As head of state, I will guarantee that Poland will have fully functioning communication, transport, health care, and evacuation systems, and I will ensure that citizens have safe shelters in emergencies.
The current international situation – above all Russia’s war against Ukraine – leaves no doubt that traditional defense must also be a priority for Poland. Security is costly, and a high level of spending in this area is necessary. Our enemies must know that war with Poland would be unprofitable for them. We therefore need:
A capable army and a strong domestic defense industry. The Polish army should be strong in its modernity. This requires improved strategic planning of arms procurement, which cannot be driven by political expediency but must genuinely reflect the military’s needs and support the growth of the domestic industry. Improving its efficiency will not only increase our security but also enhance our export capacity in armaments. Responsible thinking about the defense industry also requires securing supply chains.
Cooperation within alliances – cooperation within NATO is, for me, the foundation of Poland’s security. But we must also strengthen our own defense capabilities independent of the USA. I will cooperate with Europe on defense and jointly finance initiatives in this area. Intra-EU competition leads to the unnecessary multiplication of weapon types within the same classes. It costs billions of euros that could be spent on our shared security.
COOPERATION. As a medium-sized country, Poland must seek to increase its influence through collaboration with allies. The intensifying global rivalry between great powers threatens the stability of the international order. Poland’s membership in the European Union and our voice in the community are the key to a better future – they must not be undermined or diminished. The Union must also redefine itself. The current “regulatory superpower” model is insufficient – Europe must become stronger, through its economy, competitiveness, innovation, but also military might. This requires EU reform toward effective governance of the community, without catering to Vladimir Putin’s allies. The Union is also crucial for ensuring truly partnership-based relations with the USA and for securing a free and democratic Ukraine. Its existence is the foundation of Poland’s security.
I want to conduct a foreign policy that serves above all the prosperity of Polish women and men. However, it should be based on universal, humanistic values: solidarity among nations, human rights, and the pursuit of peace. This also means respecting international law and guaranteeing the right to asylum – while maintaining full security procedures.
FREEDOM. Everyone has the right to freedom from fear. It is complete only when our economic situation is stable, we do not fear its sudden deterioration, and our right to self-determination is respected.
One of the fundamental goals of my presidency will be to restore women’s right to decide for themselves about their bodies, motherhood, and families. I will not compromise; my goal is accessible, legal, and safe abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy.
Freedom also means freedom of speech, which today is threatened by the influence of digital giants. Poland and Europe must reclaim control of public debate. The algorithms that govern social media should be publicly known. Companies such as Meta or X must be obliged to actively combat fake news. I will also support the interests of traditional press publishers in their struggle against corporations such as Google or MSN.
EQUALITY. No state may divide its citizens into better and worse. According to the Constitution, no one in our country may be discriminated against for any reason, and everyone is equal before the law. The realization of this principle in recent years has left much to be desired. As First Citizen, I will be the guardian of those constitutional rules that have been ignored to date – I will be the guardian of equality. Everyone has the right to form a family, regardless of sexual orientation. That is why I will, as a minimum program, support the introduction of civil unions and submit a draft law on marriage equality. I will also ensure workplace equality – above all by closing the gender pay gap.
Constitutional equality also concerns equal access to public services guaranteed by the state. A place in a nursery, an appointment with a medical specialist, convenient rail connections belong to all residents of Poland, not just those in the wealthiest regions. It is time to end the division into Poland A and B.
THE RULE OF LAW. The President must be the guardian of the Constitution – therefore, one of the basic tasks of my presidency will be to organize the constitutional chaos caused by eight years of Law and Justice rule. It is time once and for all to restore the dignity of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Court, and the National Council of the Judiciary – so that no citizen has doubts about their role in the state. The Polish Constitution also clearly states that Poland is a secular state. I will uphold this principle, remove religion from schools, and abolish the tax privileges of the Catholic Church.
I will ensure that the judiciary serves the people. The duration of court proceedings must be shortened and citizens’ contact with courts and the prosecutor’s office simplified. A labor court case, a divorce, or determining child custody should not drag on for years – Polish families suffer while they wait. It is also time finally to resolve the issue of child support arrears. The task of the state and the judiciary is to look after the interests of the most vulnerable members of society: children.
