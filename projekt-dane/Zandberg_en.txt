ATOMIC POLAND To grow vigorously, the Polish economy needs reliable, clean energy. I have no doubt that, given our geographical location, there is only one sensible solution: nuclear power. A single, symbolic nuclear plant is not enough. We need Atomic Poland. This is an ambitious fifteen‐year plan to build eight nuclear units, each with a capacity of 1.5 GW.

8 NUCLEAR UNITS, AT LEAST 3 NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS
No single party or government can shoulder such an investment. We must reach a cross-party agreement on energy investments. Let us agree that, regardless of who governs in the future, the Atomic Poland project will be pursued and expanded consistently. Nuclear energy will give us what we need most right now: security, stability, and lasting economic competitiveness—while also returning its costs through savings.
“Let’s agree on Atomic Poland. This will be an ambitious fifteen‐year plan: building eight nuclear units, each of 1.5 GW.” Adrian Zandberg, Candidate for President of the Republic of Poland

HEALTH PACT: HEALTH SECURITY
Healthcare in Poland is failing. Hospitals are in serious crisis, waiting lists are growing because the state under-funds health. A demographic shift is coming—our society is aging. The number of people needing care will rise.
8% OF GDP FOR HEALTH
It’s time to adopt, under the president’s patronage, a Health Pact that guarantees funding for free medical care. Eight percent of GDP is the minimum needed to get our system back on its feet. Support this proposal.
STOP CORRUPT DOCTORS
Healthcare needs not only more funding but also cleansing of corruption. It’s pathological when a dishonest doctor first treats a patient privately, then “magically” finds a bed for them in a public hospital. Doctors should be paid very well—but we must also demand full commitment. We must enforce the rule: either you work in a public hospital or you run a private practice. As president, I will protect Poles’ health from covert privatization.
NEW DRUG FACTORIES
Shorter doctor queues alone will not guarantee health security. We must also secure access to medicines for our citizens. Today we depend on imported active pharmaceutical ingredients from Asia. A single political decision in China or India could cut off our supply of everyday essential drugs. It’s high time to build new Polish pharmaceutical factories and restore our drug sovereignty.
Only 13% of reimbursed medicines are produced domestically.
34% is the share of new certificates in the past 20 years allowing Asian manufacturers to sell drugs in Europe. (Source: politykazdrowotna.com)

NO MORE WAITING IN THE HALLWAY
Poland cannot wait in the hallway while others decide our future. We shouldn’t assume that the United States will always guarantee our security. We can’t afford that risk.
COOPERATION WITH THE NORDIC COUNTRIES
It’s time to build regional alliances. Scandinavians and many Central-Eastern European countries share our view of regional threats. Therefore, we should invest together in defense industry and deepen defense cooperation. This is the best way to fully leverage our potential. Europe must stand firmly on its own feet.
SECURITY AND NEW INDUSTRY
Imperialism threatens peace and our security. Poland must consistently stand for international law. War crimes against civilians cannot go unpunished—whether committed by the President of Russia or the Prime Minister of Israel.

INDUSTRIAL POLAND, EUROPEAN INVESTMENTS
Prosperity comes from investment. The Chinese and Americans know this, using public funds to expand infrastructure and develop new technologies. Europe has fallen behind by its own choice. Outdated EU treaties are blocking development by hindering investment financing with credit. Now, as Germany sinks into stagnation, Poland should take responsibility and push Europe to change.
SECURITY | INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT | POLAND: THE NEXT EU LEADER Poland faces many industrial challenges. Long supply chains and dependence on Asia are real risks, not only economic. The next five years are the time to expand Polish production capacity in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and metallurgy. Whether we finally undertake serious investments will determine not only our prosperity and quality jobs but also our resilience to crises.
“Rather than relying solely on guarantees from overseas, Poland should develop industrial and defense cooperation with Scandinavians, our regional neighbors, and France.” Adrian Zandberg, Candidate for President of the Republic of Poland

END THE PORK BARREL
Municipal and state‐owned companies have always been plum posts for those in power—PO, PiS, or PSL alike. They treat supervisory boards as spoils. As a result, public assets are poorly managed by unqualified people interested only in high salaries. This is how parties pay political loyalty.
ELIMINATING MUNICIPAL PATHOLOGIES
Pork barrel politics wastes our economic potential. It’s time to ruthlessly cut out this pathology. I will submit a presidential bill to eliminate supervisory boards in municipal companies, replacing them with professional ownership oversight. Local and national politicians should be banned from serving in state‐owned companies’ bodies for at least two years after leaving office. We must stop treating public assets as a trough.
1,234 members sit on supervisory boards of state‐owned companies.

STATE‐LED HOUSING CONSTRUCTION
Astronomical housing prices and obscene rents destroy the lives of the younger generation. Many Poles today cannot buy a home even with a thirty‐year mortgage. How can someone plan a family if they can never afford a place to live?
NO MORE SUBSIDIES FOR DEVELOPERS
Let’s stop wasting billions of złoty on subsidies that only drive up housing prices and ultimately enrich developers. These subsidy programs simply don’t work. If the government persists with the so-called 0% mortgage law, I will veto it. We need hard regulations to reduce rent-seeking and market speculation, not transfers to developers and banks. Poland must have a large state program for building rental housing.
STOP REAL ESTATE SPECULATION!
I propose an anti-speculation tax on third and subsequent dwellings. The richest cannot, through their luxury investments in concrete gold, deprive young Poles of a chance at a roof over their heads. With this new tax, hundreds of thousands of apartments will enter the market, lowering rental and purchase prices—even before our public rental stock is built.
“The government should develop social housing, building large-scale, well-planned, quality estates in both small and large cities.” Adrian Zandberg, Candidate for President of the Republic of Poland

POLAND IS OUR COMMON HOME
Gender equality—equal pay, equal access to healthcare, and equal treatment at work, in offices, and in courts—should be a given in 2025. Unfortunately, issues resolved decades ago elsewhere still await solutions here.
RIGHT TO ABORTION
I am a libertarian. I believe that politicians should not make personal decisions for people. The state should not impose any religion’s principles. As president, I will sign a law easing abortion restrictions and returning the decision to women.
RESPECT FOR MINORITIES
It is not the state’s role to decide whom people love or how they live. Its role is to ensure equal treatment for all.
A SECULAR STATE
Believers and atheists live side by side in Poland. No religion or belief system should be privileged. Churches should not be funded from the state budget. A secular state must rest on freedom and mutual respect. We are diverse, and Poland is our shared home.
“We take gender equality seriously. We will introduce pay transparency to end labor market discrimination.” Adrian Zandberg, Candidate for President of the Republic of Poland

DEMOCRACY WITHOUT LEGAL CORRUPTION
Multimillionaires generously finance campaigns of PO, PiS, or PSL politicians—no wonder that, after elections, public funds flow in torrents to banks and developers. Legally, it isn’t bribery, but it still endangers democracy and must be stopped.
END BUYING POLITICAL INFLUENCE
Secret influence of wealthy businessmen on politics is too great. As president, I will propose a new system of funding political parties and election campaigns. The fact that parties spend millions on billboards and paid social-media ads doesn’t make democracy stronger. We should ban such practices and ensure equal public financing for all committees. I believe the maximum donation to a campaign should be 5,000 zł. Politicians must persuade voters with arguments, not overwhelming them with expensive ads.
948,000 zł was donated to PSL by people connected to the construction sector.
7.67% is the average interest rate on mortgages in Poland.
