Development | Investment | Security
Podkarpacie is a region with proud traditions and exceptional energy. Ninety years ago, thanks to the initiative of Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, the Central Industrial District (COP) was established here, giving rise to the dynamic development of towns and cities. Today, in times of new challenges and opportunities, I propose a “New Central Industrial District” – a project backed by governmental and international investments that will make Podkarpacie the true heart of the Polish economy and security system.
The plan includes major road and railway investments (including S19, S74, and railway line upgrades), the development of defense and energy industry plants, as well as support for local businesses and innovation centers. It also envisions the expansion of social infrastructure: modernizing schools, hospitals, building modern shelters, and creating attractive leisure spaces. In total, this represents PLN 250 billion, which will contribute to the prosperity of Podkarpacie and the entire country. Let us move forward together – let Podkarpacie become the driving force of Poland!

Security Pact This is required by Poland’s national interest
Security above political divisions. Some matters transcend even the most intense political disputes. One of them is national security. Today, amid serious international challenges, we need unity in this fundamental issue – beyond politics.
Therefore, I propose a Security Pact. Here are its 5 key assumptions:
Security issues must be excluded from day-to-day political disputes. Even the harshest campaign cannot justify, for example, revealing military plans. Never again.
The National Security Council with the participation of the President of Poland and all political forces must meet at least once every 60 days.
Increase defense spending to 5% of GDP.
Establish the "Second Mission" Center to engage veterans and former officers in training new specialists for the state.
At least 50% of funds for the modernization of the Armed Forces must be invested in Polish industry.
These are issues that demand cross-party consensus. This is required by Poland’s national interest.

A modern economy, strong industry, a strong Poland. Supporting Polish entrepreneurs, investing in modern technologies, and protecting the domestic market are the pillars of our program. Poland has the chance to become a strong economic player, energy independent, and capable of competing globally. Thanks to a pragmatic approach to the economy, we build stability and development for all Poles.
Active promotion of Polish companies in foreign markets.
Simplification of economic law and support for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Development of the Polish defense and technology industries.
Protection of Polish farmers against unfair imports.
Strengthening Poland's position in Europe through investments in innovation and scientific research.
Energy independence through the development of renewable energy sources (RES).

Security, equality, social responsibility. Common sense should guide every area of social life. We want to combine pragmatism with care for citizens to ensure social, economic, and cultural security while protecting Poland’s future.
Limiting the 800+ benefit for Ukrainian citizens only to those who live and work in Poland. Supporting those who pay taxes in Poland is fair and prevents a situation where coming to Poland only for social support becomes beneficial.
Liberalization of abortion law and support for the in vitro program.
Zero tolerance for crime.
Investment in equal access to public services (schools, hospitals).
Protection and promotion of regional identity.

PLN 2 billion annually for cities and regions needing real change. The Presidential Investment Fund is a tool for real support of regions struggling with long-term economic and social problems. The fund will enable effective cooperation between the government, local authorities, and communities, focusing on real problems and solutions. It is a key support element for cities and regions affected by the post-1989 transformation. Key points:
Fund with an annual budget of PLN 2 billion.
Local public consultations as the basis for investment decisions.
Implementation of projects to modernize social and transport infrastructure.
Creation of new jobs and economic revitalization.
Transparency in decision-making, in cooperation with residents.

Efficient, modern, and innovative Poland
Enough of chaotic regulations and bureaucracy that wastes the time and energy of millions of Poles. We want a Poland where simple rules support development – instead of holding it back. That’s why we propose concrete reforms: fewer burdens, less paperwork, user-friendly offices, and more efficient administration. Thanks to expert knowledge, data analysis, and modern technologies, we will build a state that simply works – for entrepreneurs and all citizens. Our proposals:
1-for-2: every new regulation means eliminating two existing ones.
EU + 0: zero additional rules when implementing EU law.
Tax settlement: support for businesses in crisis, flexible debt repayment negotiations, and a partnership-based approach from the Tax Office.
Presumption of taxpayer innocence: all doubts resolved in their favor.
Clear taxation: increasing the number of general interpretations issued by the Ministry of Finance.
Automatic data retrieval from public registers, ending unnecessary paperwork – e.g., data automatically pulled from the PESEL register.
Expansion of the mObywatel app – access to medical test results, digital referrals, and an AI-supported queuing system.
