I. Reconstruction of the fundamental principles of State operation
We introduce a 100 % principle of reciprocity in international relations. Any burden, ban, limit or restriction imposed by a state or any other entity under international law against the Republic of Poland or its citizen shall be immediately and symmetrically implemented against that entity. An exception applies if retaliatory measures are not in Poland’s interest.
We immediately suspend all foreign transfers lacking a constitutional legal basis under the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. We suspend aid directed to other states and their citizens implemented without a constitutional legal basis. We suspend all social transfers to persons without Polish citizenship implemented without a constitutional legal basis.
We criminalize—under penalty of law—any challenge to the authority or judgments of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Tribunal, as well as to the authority and decisions of the Supreme Audit Office (NIK) and the National Bank of Poland (NBP). We initiate criminal proceedings against individuals, domestic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and international legal entities that undermine the legitimacy and foundations of Poland’s sovereignty.
We relentlessly prosecute violations of Poland’s good name. We initiate criminal proceedings against persons, domestic institutions (including NGOs) and international organizations acting to Poland’s reputational detriment, harming the Polish nation and the entirety of Poland’s national heritage, including historical truth.
We ban censorship in any social, economic, or political sphere.
We derogate all legal acts introducing a hate-speech ban, deeming them incompatible with the constitutional right to freedom of speech. We abolish all codes of ethics. Only the Constitution of the Republic of Poland shall define the dignity of a citizen’s conduct.
We suspend and prohibit financing and promotion of anti-Polonism. We fight the promotion of Marxism, Bolshevism, Communism, Fascism, Nazism, Banderism, Stalinism, Hitlerism, “climatism,” segregationism, including “sanitary segregation.” For our children’s sake, we oppose promoting pornography and transgender ideology or gender-change procedures.
We prohibit political activities aimed at liquidating the Polish state or transforming it into part of a federal or unitary European Union. We firmly reject a “State Europe.” Any amendments to EU treaties require the Polish people’s consent via binding referendum. Any transfer of national authority to an international organization by a public-administration representative without such referendum consent shall incur a minimum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.
We ban incurring new obligations of Poland or the Polish nation toward other states or international organizations without the nation’s consent via referendum. Signing such obligations without citizen approval will incur at least 10 years’ imprisonment. We introduce asset forfeiture in favor of the state treasury for public-administration members who commit such unauthorized acts.
We reject any right to restitution of property under the Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today Act of 2017 (“Act 447”). We assert—and will fight internationally—that only the perpetrator of a crime may grant reparations. We invite representatives of the USA, Israel, African states, and other willing partners to collaborate in securing just reparations from Germany.
We ban construction of mosques and activities of organizations promoting Islam on Polish territory. We prohibit wearing the burqa and other face-covering religious garments in public. Public manifestation of Islam is forbidden.
We prohibit deployment of Polish military forces abroad, except for training purposes or under NATO/UN operations involving special units, naval forces, or air forces.
We guarantee citizens’ self-determination throughout Poland. Direct democracy becomes the supreme decision-making mechanism. We categorically reject any authoritarian tendencies of political parties. We withdraw from extraterritorial “eco-regulations” that limit Poland’s control, such as Natura 2000 (Birds and Habitats Directives). At the same time, we genuinely protect Polish forests and ensure their public status. We reject AMLA regulations and any similar citizen-surveillance systems. We base our economy on domestic resources, launching extraction of all economically essential raw materials. Land becomes a strategic resource, unsellable to foreigners (only leasable). We declare natural deposits strategic assets, extractable only by 100 % Polish-owned entities. The state shall support these entities in securing capital and partners.

II. “First the economy and agriculture – you fool!”
We renounce the European Green Deal and prosecute politicians who actively implemented it in Poland. We withdraw from ETS 1, ETS 2, and ETS 3. We annul the EU Buildings Directive. We abolish ESG and BDO obligations, freeing SMEs from these burdens.
We halt the closure of coal mines, power plants, and CHP plants fueled by fossil fuels. We implement a multi-year plan for their technological and financial reinforcement. We hold competitions at technical universities to improve fossil-fuel technologies and minimize pollution.
We adjust VAT, PIT, and CIT rates according to enterprise size. Entities pay a percentage of the standard rate: micro 25 %, small 50 %, medium 75 %, large 100 %.
We introduce a turnover tax on multinational corporations, setting a minimum liability based on the sector’s average burden.
We ban usury and payday loans. Commercial banks must offer consumer loans capped at an APR no higher than inflation + 1 %.
We suspend intrusive tax authority audits of small taxpayers. Simultaneously, we launch rigorous, uncompromising inspections of foreign firms operating in Poland. We eliminate bureaucratic burdens and unnecessary regulations hindering micro, small, and medium entrepreneurs.
We financially penalize civil servants for delayed decisions (upon entrepreneurs’ request). All decisions must be issued within 60 days. We dismantle local cartels and anti-competitive collusion. We impose heavy fines on officials conspiring against entrepreneurs.
We break banks’ collusion. We cap credit costs and raise deposit rates by taxing banks’ excess profits. We penalize banks and “banksters” for introducing toxic financial instruments—e.g., Swiss-franc loans or other abusive-clause contracts. All client losses from such instruments are borne by the banks and their management from personal assets.
We enshrine the Polish Złoty in the Constitution as the inalienable right of citizens to their own currency. We constitutionally guarantee unlimited cash usage. We lift ATM withdrawal limits and impose a PLN 1 million fine for each ATM removed by banks. Banks in Poland must maintain ATMs at a ratio of one per 5,000 inhabitants in each area.
We guarantee that money in a personal bank account belongs to the citizen, not the bank. Banks are liable for any theft from an account or unauthorized third-party loan taken without the citizen’s knowledge.
We cap foreign-entity shares in strategic sectors—banking, media, energy, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture—at 25 %. In other sectors, the upper limit follows reciprocity: it equals the domestic-capital market share of the foreign investor’s home country.
We ban employing drivers without a Polish driving-license exam, Polish-language proficiency, and city topography knowledge in taxi and ride-service companies. We regulate transport: each taxi must have separate passenger and driver compartments, modeled on London cabs. Vehicles of the same model and color serve each city. Foreign drivers must pass a B2-level Polish exam. We set official per-kilometer fares and flat rates for airport/train-station transfers into city zones. Charging unauthorized fees results in lifelong revocation of taxi-driver licenses in all service types. All drivers must carry third-party liability insurance of at least PLN 1 million.
We regulate the profession of cosmetologist, granting official authorization for certain medical procedures.
We classify agriculture, forestry, and fisheries as strategic sectors under special protection.
We guarantee Saturday agricultural markets in city centers. Farmers may sell produce directly from carts, tractors, or stalls. Farmers are exempt from fiscalization requirements for such sales.
We impose anti-dumping duties and quotas on agricultural imports from Ukraine—and from any state acting against Polish agricultural interests and food producers.
We build the “Polska” brand. We massively promote our culture, art, and other creative achievements. We publicize scientific and economic successes. We promote tourism and Poland’s attractions.
We require every motorway service area (MOP) and petrol station on expressways and motorways to preferentially lease premises to Polish restaurant industries. Within five years, most fast-food outlets must be replaced by genuine restaurants, bars, and inns serving real food.
We introduce a single annual road-use fee (annual vignette) of PLN 70 for passenger cars on all tolled roads for Polish citizens. We offer 7, 10, 30, 90-day, half-year, and annual vignettes for foreign-registered vehicles. Foreigners pay reciprocal rates—matching what their country charges Poles—never less than PLN 70.

III. Community building and mutual protection
Building demographic potential – “RABBIT PLUS” program 33. We renounce the Global Compact for Migration and sue the European Commission at the CJEU. We deport illegal migrants to their point of origin. Smuggling migrants by foreign-state agents or Polish citizens results in immediate arrest and criminal charges.
We automatically reserve a citizen’s PESEL number and identity card/passport data. The state must protect citizens’ data. Citizens may unlock data in the mObywatel app for verification purposes (e.g., contract signing). After use, data is automatically re-reserved.
We prohibit marketing of products and services to minors. We enact landscape and urban-space protection laws to eliminate public advertising. We remove advertisements from cities and roadways.
We launch a national critical-infrastructure program, banning construction in flood zones and developing crisis-service coordination. Municipalities build shelter networks to accommodate 120 % of residents.
We guarantee the right to self-defense. We eliminate the notion of “exceeding defense limits.” Anyone defending life, health, or property—one’s own or another’s—can be certain the law and the state support them.
We ban foreign police and other security-service presence in Poland. We repeal Article 1066 (the 7 February 2014 Act on foreign officers in joint operations or actions on Polish territory).
We halt state-, judicial-, and prosecutorial-driven family destruction (parental alienation). We hold psychologists, psychiatrists, judges, prosecutors, and media personnel accountable for family breakdowns, alienation, and the mental collapse of younger generations.
IV. Building demographic potential – “RABBIT PLUS” program
We launch low-interest credit lines at the BGK Bank exclusively for Polish citizens. Loans at a fixed rate of 0.5 % are designated for purchasing a first apartment on the secondary market (particularly in heritage buildings) or building a home. Additionally, BGK provides a non-repayable grant of PLN 150 000 for an apartment or PLN 200 000 for a house for first-time buyers who are married. The grant becomes irrecoverable if the couple has one child within two years before or after signing the loan agreement. A second and each subsequent child lead to 20 % loan forgiveness (up to PLN 100 000 per child). Municipal housing is transferred to market terms for families with at least three children, with a 90 % discount. Vacant public-sector properties are sold for PLN 1.
We guarantee full reimbursement of diagnostic‐visit costs for couples trying to conceive.
We guarantee that any woman who gives birth to her first child before age 26 is exempt from PIT for the next seven years; each subsequent child extends the exemption by another seven years under individual taxation.
We introduce the “BEAUTIFUL MOTHER PLUS” voucher for beauty, dental, medical, physiotherapy, optical, sports or spa services—PLN 700 per year per child, cumulative over years, plus a 7 % bonus per grandchild and great-grandchild. Vouchers redeemable only with Polish businesses.
We introduce the “STRONG FATHER PLUS” voucher for sporting, fishing, hunting, medical, physiotherapy, optical, or vocational‐training services—PLN 700 per year per dependent child, cumulative over years. Vouchers redeemable only with Polish businesses.

V. Social capital, education and respect – the glue of our Nation
We erect triumphal arches commemorating Independence and Poland’s greatest military victories; monuments to mothers, wives, and daughters of wartime and communist eras; promote all living Warsaw Uprising veterans to the rank of general with corresponding pensions; and install grand statues of our kings, commanders, and foremost figures in science and culture.
We enrich history textbooks with comprehensive accounts of Poles’ contributions to world civilizations.
We strengthen the pension system with dividend inflows from state-owned enterprises, the National Bank of Poland, and natural-resource revenues.
We abolish fixed retirement age. Citizens may view an up-to-date estimate of their future pension alongside their bank account and choose when to retire.
We revise pension revaluation rules: all pensions, including military and service pensions, increase proportionally to wage growth.
We ensure accessible infrastructure (ramps, elevators, adapted transport) and an inclusive approach in education, employment, and culture for persons with disabilities. We launch policies to remove labor-market and social barriers. Medical—but not functional—assessment is definitive.
We reimburse 100 % of necessary medical and rehabilitation equipment—of Polish manufacture—for persons with disabilities and elderly persons with impairments, guaranteeing delivery within 30 days; otherwise they may purchase the item and submit an invoice for refund within 14 days via PFRON.
We support, integrate, and unite all citizens socially and psychologically, dismantling stereotypes and divisions, fostering social awareness, combating prejudice, and promoting equality and acceptance.
We establish orphanages, preschools, and nurseries adjacent to care homes to bridge generations.
We convert migrant centers into Intergenerational Integration Centers.
We build basic drift tracks for youth in every commune/municipal association and safe race tracks for cars and motorcycles in every county to curb dangerous urban driving.
We guarantee the existence of family allotment gardens, prohibiting their liquidation or repurposing.
We launch an immigration and repatriation program for Poles from the East, covering relocation and start-up costs in their ancestral homeland.
We guarantee independence for hunters, anglers, rural housewives’ circles, volunteer fire brigades and other social organizations from political parties and ministries.
We abolish regional licensing (“fishing cards” etc.): one nationwide permit obtainable at local offices.
We insure drivers—rather than vehicles—under liability policies; only comprehensive (AC) covers the car.
We ban cell phones and internet-connected devices in schools, except school-provided equipment (“CLEAN MIND PLUS” program).

VI. A healthy and prudent Nation
We comprehensively reform health care. Health contributions are tied to preventive behavior. We improve public-health budget management and decision-making workflows—restoring reference hospitals and NFZ funding. We revise drug policy, entitlements, and access to therapies. We foster domestic pharmaceutical production to secure essential medicines. We ensure equitable public-fund access by integrating insurers and individual health policies.
We support citizens affected by rare diseases and their families, holding biannual broad meetings with patient and caregiver organizations, aiding them with NFZ and Ministry of Health interactions, and promoting social education and destigmatization.
We guarantee the right to alternative and natural therapies alongside conventional medicine. Any treatment improving health or well‐being is legal and desirable. Patients and families may bring legal action against providers of alternative methods if harmed. We ban beneficiaries of pharmaceutical or medical-device producers from holding positions in medical organizations; all experts and experts‐witnesses must be free of financial or non-financial ties. We codify the Hippocratic Oath into law, sworn publicly before a notary.
We provide free health care only to Polish citizens; foreigners pay full cost directly or via private insurers.
We allow patients and families to choose “futile therapy.” Every citizen has the right to fight for life regardless of condition.
We prohibit doctors and nurses from simultaneous public- and private-sector employment to avoid conflicts of interest.
We introduce mandatory insurance for mountain and water tourism activities.
We remove “pathological” sex-education from schools, replacing it with robust programs protecting youth from pedophilia, pornography, STIs, and sexual violence. We ban minors from TikTok and similar harmful apps under UOKiK enforcement.
We prohibit advertising of medicines, supplements, and alcohol in media and public spaces. We tighten public-space protection against illegal promotion; municipalities, universities, sports organizations, and state bodies may not collaborate with harmful‐substance producers.

VII. Military and anti-crisis power of the Republic of Poland
We introduce universal defense, self-defense, and first-aid training, with costs tax-deductible.
We ensure society is equipped with defense and crisis-management gear, with tax deductions for enterprise purchases.
We create the “POLAND’S FIST” system (replacing “Eastern Shield”) and the “TITANIUM DOME” air-defense network, maintain 100 % readiness for offensive action in case of invasion, including the capability to strike adversary territory, and fully seal borders—opening fire immediately on illegal crossings.
We establish a shooting range and secure arms storage in every commune—one per 10 000 residents.
We de-politicize the army, police, fire service, border guard, and other agencies under the “RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABILITY” program: promotions based solely on qualifications and evaluations by superiors, subordinates, and union representatives.
We bolster the military with structures of the Local Citizen Self-Defense (GSO), leveraging volunteer fire brigades, hunting clubs, and rural housewives’ circles.
We ensure full independence in producing weapons, ammunition, field‐medicine supplies, and food stocks to meet military and civilian needs during war or emergencies. We organize storage and rotation systems to safeguard people and animals. We scale domestic production of arms, military equipment, and ammunition in cooperation with Turkey and India, creating a special economic zone for their manufacturers in the Suwałki Corridor.
