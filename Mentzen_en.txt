1. Sovereignty According to the Constitution, the President of the Republic of Poland is the guardian of the country’s sovereignty and security. Until now, previous presidents have failed to fulfill this obligation. I will not allow Poland to lose further competencies in internal matters to the European Union, nor to changes in EU treaties that would limit our influence within the EU, such as depriving Poland of the right to veto. I will ensure the primacy of the Polish Constitution over EU law, preserve the Polish złoty as our currency, and in foreign policy, I will support the use of the EU veto right in matters important to our country.
2. Strong Military Poland needs a strong military. If we do not invest in our army, we may one day be forced to fund someone else’s. We must urgently expand domestic production of weapons and ammunition, and ensure the training of reservists who could be mobilized in case of war. Political influence over the Polish Armed Forces must be reduced, as political decisions usually weaken our defense capabilities. As Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, I will modernize and increase the operational capacity of the Polish Army. Only our own army can guarantee security in times of global tensions and enemies of Poland.
3. Secure Borders For years, Europe has been stormed by waves of illegal immigrants. The effects of mass, uncontrolled immigration from Asia and Africa are evident in France, Germany, the UK, and Sweden. We must defend Polish borders against the assault of criminals from the Middle East and Putin’s useful idiots who help them break through our frontier. Enough with disrespecting the Polish uniform. We want Poles to continue enjoying safety in their cities. We don’t want to fear for our wives and daughters. We will defend our homeland’s security!
4. Strong Economy The economy is the foundation of our country’s development. Without a strong economy, there will be no improvement in living standards or funds for defense. By eliminating unnecessary regulations, we will give Poles new opportunities for growth. Regulations should target large multinational corporations, tech oligopolies, and pharmaceutical giants—not small Polish businesses. We will implement the "EU+0" rule: EU directives will be adopted in the minimal, necessary version only, without additional burdens on Poles. Redundant state-owned companies should be privatized, and all politicians removed from those that remain.
5. Low and Simple Taxes Poland currently has one of the most complicated and unfriendly tax systems in Europe. As president, I will submit to the Sejm a comprehensive tax reform to make Poland a model, encouraging investment with low fiscal burdens and simple law that doesn’t require months of battling with officials. We will have the simplest tax system in the entire EU. I will ensure that entrepreneurs no longer feel like criminals during inspections. I will abolish inheritance tax, the Belka tax, and the PCC on apartments. I will significantly simplify PIT, CIT, and VAT. Social security contributions will be voluntary for entrepreneurs, and we will return to the pre-"Polish Deal" health contribution model.
6. Halting Leftist Ideology The radical left has long been pushing a cultural revolution aimed at reshaping our families, language, and culture. The left is creating a world with only one “correct” way of thinking, rejecting our cultural heritage rooted in Latin civilization. We are supposed to be ashamed of our history and religion, deny basic biological facts, and censor our own speech. This ideological experiment on society must be stopped immediately. We will defend normalcy in Poland, protect our children from leftist demoralizers, and not allow anyone to be persecuted for their views or speech just because they differ from leftist propaganda.
7. Defense of Free Speech Freedom of speech is under threat from both the state—trying to impose leftist political correctness—and from major social media platforms that censor views and information they deem harmful. That’s why I demand full freedom of speech, as it functions in the USA. Free speech is essential to honest public debate and the pursuit of truth. A person is not free if they cannot say what they think. Politicians and social media platform owners should not have the right to censor Polish citizens.
8. Personal Freedom Poles are mature and responsible citizens and should not be treated by their own state like children. We must radically expand personal freedom. That’s why I will call for the legalization of poker and marijuana, rational access to firearms, and laws that promote responsibility rather than bans. At the same time, many of our freedoms must be defended. As president, I will not allow our rights to be taken away—such as the freedom to travel, choose our lifestyle, or produce and consume meat. Officials should not interfere in parenting or family life. I will stop the practice of taking children away from parents and the enforcement of mandatory vaccinations. I will resist mass internet surveillance. Poles must have the right to privacy.
9. Rejection of the Green Deal The PiS government agreed to implement the European Green Deal. If carried out, this insane plan will cost Poles trillions of złoty. The EU is responsible for only a small percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions but has chosen economic suicide in the name of climate protection. The Green Deal means drastically higher living costs and reduced competitiveness for European industry, which is relocating to Asia. We must stop these harmful regulations before they take effect and cause climate poverty. It’s time to reject the Green Deal!
10. Energy Security Affordable energy is essential for economic growth and low living costs. We need diversified energy sources. We cannot rely on a single energy source or supplier. Poland also cannot fully rely on renewable energy, as our needs cannot be met by wind and solar alone. My priority will be to deregulate energy production, reduce energy taxes, and invest in nuclear energy, including SMRs, to give us independence and ensure energy security in times of serious crises.
11. Defense of Polish Agriculture Food security is in the interest of all Poles. It is crucial that in times of crisis—caused by war, natural disasters, or other tragic events—we are not dependent on foreign food supplies. The European Union wants agriculture in Europe to become entirely unprofitable and to shift food production to South America and Ukraine. This poses a huge threat to Poland’s security. Therefore, I reject the anti-farmer policies of the European Commission, supported by both PiS and PO, as well as harmful regulations and unnecessary bureaucracy. I demand the creation of favorable conditions for domestic food production.
12. No Polish Troops in Ukraine Poland’s and Poles’ security is my top priority, especially with a war raging beyond our border. Poland has helped Ukraine generously since the first days of the war with Russia, but we must never allow Poland to share Ukraine’s fate. As Commander-in-Chief, I will never agree to sending Polish troops to Ukraine. I oppose any actions that could involve our homeland in this war. Poland must remain a safe and strong country.
13. Modern Infrastructure Economic growth requires developed infrastructure—expressways, highways, and river transport. Poland also needs the Central Communication Port and port development. Major infrastructure projects take years to complete, so they must continue despite changes in government. They should not be a part of everyday political games.
14. Reducing Bureaucracy Bureaucracy consumes time and money. Entrepreneurs, instead of developing their businesses, are burdened with red tape, which increases delays and costs in matters that should be simple. Frequent inspections treat honest citizens like criminals. As president, I will work to eliminate unnecessary regulations that waste Poles’ time and money. I also call for the abolition of redundant government institutions and offices that serve only to control citizens and squander public funds. I will end the impunity of officials, whose mistakes often cost Poles their property and health.
15. Defense of Cash Cash means freedom! Without cash transactions, we are at the mercy of digital bank records—and, as the Canadian government already proved, money in banks can be easily frozen for citizens who dare protest against the government. I will not accept the replacement of cash with digital currency. As president, I will initiate a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to use cash so that citizens can decide how to save and spend their money.
16. Improving the Judiciary The judiciary should protect citizens from criminals and from abuses of power by politicians and officials, as well as resolve disputes between citizens. Today, we cannot feel safe in this regard. Verdicts—and even hearings—can take years, despite Poland having more judges per 100,000 residents than the Netherlands, Sweden, or Germany. We must eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy in the courts. I also demand true depoliticization of the judiciary, including a constitutional reset of the Constitutional Tribunal and the National Council of the Judiciary. These institutions, and all courts, must no longer be political tools of successive governments.
17. Better Education Education in Poland is falling behind a rapidly changing world. Schools are overregulated and dependent on politicized educational boards. Governments change curricula not to improve learning but to indoctrinate children. We need competition in education, adaptation to modern technology, and parental influence over child-rearing. Homeschooling must be made easier. Fewer bureaucrats, fewer politicians, more practical knowledge, and more freedom for students, parents, and teachers.
18. Efficient Healthcare Poland’s healthcare system is ineffective. Adding more money through higher health contributions won’t fix the problem—it will only increase waste. Poles don’t trust public healthcare, despite paying huge contributions, and are forced to seek private care. I will fix the healthcare system. We need systemic reform and to break the National Health Fund’s monopoly. Monopolies are always inefficient—especially state-run ones. I will end this outdated healthcare system and, inspired by Germany and Singapore, introduce competing social insurance funds.
19. Freeing Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are suppressed in Poland because the state cannot control them. As a result, companies trying to operate in this modern sector had to close or leave Poland. As president, I will push for the liberalization of cryptocurrency markets and ensure that Poland has the most crypto-friendly regulations in the entire EU. This will turn Poland into a European hub for crypto firms, attracting modern businesses and creating high-paying jobs.
20. Ending the War on Drivers PiS and PO politicians jointly wage a war on drivers. They introduced the Clean Transport Zone to ban from city centers everyone who cannot afford a new car. The car is a primary means of transportation for millions of Poles. I will put an end to the harassment of drivers. We need fast roads, parking spaces, and cheaper fuel. Poles deserve to own their own cars. I will not allow politicians to turn car ownership into a privilege for the few.
