A well-prepared Polexit. I will bid the Green Deal farewell along with its climate falsehood.
I will not send Polish soldiers to Ukraine—or to any other foreign war.
I will not allow sexual deviants to raise our children.
Germans, Jews, and Banderites will not be permitted to falsify our history. The exhumation in Jedwabne must be resumed.
Officials and politicians—leave Polish entrepreneurs, farmers, and breeders in peace! PIT, CIT, PCC, and ZUS to the dustbin. I will unleash the creativity and innovation of Polish engineers, including in so-called artificial intelligence and cutting-edge technologies.
I will end the diktat of agents, lobbyists, corporations, and foreign embassies—there will be a law on foreign agents, just like in the USA or Russia.
I will pursue a multidirectional foreign policy; I want good relations with all our neighbors. Let us build an energy bridge and secure a mutually guaranteed, safe border with Belarus.
Strict rules for immigrants. I will declare an immigration moratorium—no migration pacts and no foreigner integration centers.
A strong minimal state. I will limit monopoly diktats and politicians’ influence over healthcare, education, information flow, and public funds—so they cannot bicker over secondary concerns while neglecting Poland’s most vital matters.
I will declassify the annex to the WSI dissolution report. I will demand clarification of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Blessed Fr. Jerzy Popiełuszko, Andrzej Lepper, Gen. Sławomir Petelicki, Gen. Marek Papała, and others.
I will not sell off Polish land or its resources. I don’t want our children and grandchildren to have to leave their parents and grandparents just to get ahead abroad.
A national awakening is essential: perhaps no one will defend Poland if we do not first defend our families, our sovereignty, our freedom, our lives, our property, and our Catholic tradition ourselves.
FREEDOM AND SECURITY ✔ Within the competencies available to me, I will defend the freedoms and security of Poles:
As President of the Republic of Poland, I will employ every legal tool and mode of action at my disposal. ✗ What I will certainly not do—and what I will protect Poles against.
DEFENSE ✔ I consider defense, security, and high-quality infrastructure fundamental state tasks that should be publicly funded first and foremost. ✔ I will ensure the proper strengthening of the Polish army. I will strive to rebuild domestic defense-industry production capabilities, to launch a fully functional set of Polish military reconnaissance satellites, and to implement any other solutions the military deems essential for defending the country. ✔ I believe that the foundation of Polish sovereignty is a strong army with high morale and good relations with neighbors. This does not preclude international military alliances, but Polish defense cannot be dependent on our allies’ posture. ✔ I am convinced that appropriate military training of all conscription-age men is indispensable for state security. ✔ I will advocate for the dignity of the Polish soldier and respect for the uniform. ✔ I will provide modern equipment for all Polish uniformed services. ✔ I will restore public trust in our security services. ✗ I will not send Polish soldiers to the Ukrainian war. ✗ I oppose subordinating the Polish Armed Forces to foreign command. I want a strong Polish army, not a European army. ✗ I will not agree to deploy Polish troops abroad in the interests of other states, except for joint NATO defense actions with proportional military engagement by all NATO members and taking into account Poland’s situation as a frontline state. ✗ I will not allow Poland to be disarmed while foreign nations are rearmed. I will not let firefighters, paramedics, or police officers be stripped of their tools.
LIFE AND HEALTH ✔ I will do everything in my power to protect the inalienable human right to life from conception to natural death. ✔ I want Poland to be the safe first-choice country for affluent seniors afraid of euthanasia at home. ✔ Defenders of the unborn and a special plenipotentiary for the highest life-protection standards will sit on the National Security Council. ✔ I will support the introduction of genuine competition in health insurance and move away from the NFZ monopoly. ✔ I will defend medical confidentiality and insist that the state cannot force citizens into medical procedures. ✔ I will seek to identify and punish those responsible for the deaths of a quarter-million Poles during the so-called pandemic, so that systemic bans on treating patients never happen again. ✔ I will back any initiative that shortens waiting times for doctors and medical procedures without imposing new taxes on citizens. ✔ I will support any solution that improves working conditions in emergency medicine and the health system without extra taxes. ✔ I want to remove barriers to training more doctors and medical staff, eliminate the reasons they emigrate, and prevent unqualified foreign-language staff from displacing them. ✔ I will strive to ensure that citizens can afford comprehensive private health insurance. ✗ I oppose unlawful segregation, sanitary discrimination, and forced vaccinations. ✗ I will not tolerate the abortion, eugenics, or “gender-change” industries. ✗ I will prevent a repeat of excess deaths and people suffering and dying in isolation during pandemic tyranny. ✗ I do not want Poland’s continued participation in the WHO. ✗ I will not allow a replay of the past lawlessness of Sanepid. ✗ I want to curb the influence of interest groups, including international pharmaceutical corporations.
FAMILY AND UPBRINGING ✔ I believe the family is not a social experiment but the foundation of Latin civilization, and it must be specially protected. ✔ I will seek to improve the economic conditions of Polish families and lower their utility bills, waste-collection charges, loan installments, etc. ✔ I support freeing the housing market from investment funds by abolishing the capital-gains tax. ✔ I support lowering housing prices through deregulation, removing fiscal surcharges, and rejecting EU requirements like triple-glazed windows, mechanical heat-recovery ventilation, or heating restrictions. ✔ I believe economic solutions should allow a mother (or father) to choose between working and caring for a child without financial ruin. ✔ I will side with the parental authority of both parents. ✔ I will defend parents unjustly deprived of or hindered in their contact with their children. ✔ I support the subservient role of schools to parental will; education should be in the hands of parents and school principals, not ministers or education boards. ✔ I back initiatives against children’s and youth’s addiction to phones, social media, and virtual reality. ✔ I will seek to amend the so-called “Apartment for Accusation” law so that in domestic violence accusations, the case is heard immediately by a court. ✗ I will not sign laws that restrict the family’s role relative to the bureaucracy. ✗ I will do everything possible to stop the demoralizing influence of gender ideology and the LGBT lobby. ✗ I oppose recognizing same-sex unions or their adoption of children. ✗ I believe that corrupting children, selling and advertising cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, abortifacients, or other harmful substances to minors should be a crime, as should attempts to circumvent such bans. ✗ I will oppose phenomena causing Poland’s demographic collapse, including adverse economic, propaganda, and cultural trends. ✗ The EU construction directive must be rejected. ✗ I share the many arguments against compulsory military service for women.
ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND ECONOMY ✔ I stand for broad economic freedom for all Polish entrepreneurs. ✔ I will work to completely abandon the Green, Blue, and other European “Deals” in Poland, reject the ETS systems, and remove imposed obstacles that hamper Polish businesses. ✔ I will use my powers to protect the entrepreneurship, creativity, and initiative of Poles—especially young people entering the job market whose drive is too often crushed by penalties for minor formal errors. ✔ I will support every initiative that removes barriers to market entry for new Polish entrepreneurs. ✔ By striving to eliminate bureaucratic burdens and poor legislation, I will unleash the potential of Poles so they can flourish in their Homeland. ✔ I favor radical deregulation. ✔ I will work to ensure that Poles fully reap the fruits of their labor. ✔ I believe Poland should generate energy from the cheapest available sources—including hard coal, lignite, natural gas, nuclear power, and geothermal energy—without excluding hydro, wind, or solar, provided their use does not burden the rest of society or threaten system stability in case of temporary unavailability. ✔ I will strive to ensure the tax system and public procurement laws protect Polish entrepreneurs. ✔ I want to abolish PIT (including taxes on pensions and annuities), the “Belka” tax on savings, CIT, PCC, inheritance and gift taxes, and ultimately VAT. ✔ I support voluntary ZUS contributions for all and a gradual replacement of the pension-pyramid system with a declining pension levy. ✔ I will use legislative initiative to eliminate penalizing active entrepreneurs with a health insurance contribution. ✔ I believe officials should bear liability—including financial—for their bad decisions. ✔ I want a uniform interpretation of the law, regardless of who asks. ✔ I think the state should act as an antitrust authority and defend every Polish entrepreneur’s right to free-market mechanisms. ✔ I support drastically limiting privileges and monopolies of banks and professional corporations (e.g., medical chambers). I will appoint a special plenipotentiary to prosecute harmful monopolies, especially in finance, information flow, and economic and professional freedom. ✔ I believe the National Bank of Poland should not issue more money than the value of newly produced goods, and inflation must be near zero. ✔ The Polish Złoty should be printed in Poland. ✔ In my decisions, I will treat central taxes as exceptions—leviable only for functions essential to a minimal, efficient state. ✔ I will ensure charity faces no systemic obstacles, yet is not state-funded. ✔ I hold that debt may be enforced only up to the value of the financed asset. ✔ I will be guided by the principle that wealth comes from work, free exchange, and consent—not from subsidies, grants, or speculation. ✔ I believe participants in free economic life should follow principles derived from Catholic morality. ✗ I will oppose any laws that maintain or increase bureaucracy and restrictions on Polish business. ✗ I will not accept forced VAT payment on an unpaid invoice. ✗ I reject economic centralization and micromanagement of entrepreneurship by politicians and officials. ✗ I refuse to criminalize sidewalk parsley sales, lemonade sold by children, or after-hours light bulb repair without a receipt. ✗ I will not sign any law that encourages informant culture. ✗ I will oppose any measures privileging foreign economic entities over Polish firms or allowing them to oust Polish companies from a market sector. ✗ I will prevent Poland from being exploited by foreign capital and reduced to a colony transferring Poles’ labor fruits abroad. ✗ I will block any restrictions on cash transactions, currency exchange, or access to various denominations. ✗ I will resist efforts to weaken the Polish Złoty or replace it with a foreign currency (e.g., the euro). ✗ I will fight usury and economic enslavement. ✗ I favor, and ultimately will ban, deficit budgeting. ✗ I do not consent to indebting the state at the expense of our children and grandchildren. Existing debt should be “domesticated,” i.e., repaid to Polish entities and citizens. We must eliminate paying billions in interest on foreign debt. ✗ I will block policies causing Polish labor emigration and support measures encouraging return to Poland.
FARMERS AND BREEDERS ✔ In the transitional period before leaving the EU, I will restore the supremacy of Polish law over EU law. EU regulations must not force large-scale farms. ✔ I will defend farmers and breeders against unfair state repression and against animal-rights organizations abusing protection laws. Farmers and breeders must again be masters of their land. ✔ I hold that family farms are vital to food security and Poland’s cultural heritage and therefore deserve special protection. ✔ I believe border controls must be reinstated to protect Polish farmers and breeders from unfair competition, stop imports of expired or toxic food, and prevent turning Poland into a waste dump. ✔ I will back any solution fostering healthy-food production and agricultural development in Poland without EU subsidies, direct payments, directives, or restrictions. ✗ I will not allow farmers to be robbed or sabotaged. ✗ I will not permit the sell-off of Polish land. ✗ I will prevent consumer poisoning. ✗ I will not accept mechanisms enabling foreign capital to take over Polish food production and trade markets. ✗ I will strive to eliminate harmful “intensive fattening” practices. ✗ I oppose imposing on Polish farmers any consequences of the EU-Mercosur agreement.
SOVEREIGNTY AND FOREIGN POLICY ✔ In relations with other states, I will pursue a multidirectional policy guided primarily by Poland’s interest. ✔ I want to cooperate with various countries—including BRICS and EFTA members—and cultivate good relations with the USA, China, Germany, Belarus, France, Russia, India, Hungary, and others. ✔ I will work to repair relations with all our neighbors. ✔ I believe moral and sentimental considerations in international politics should be secondary. I will not refuse cooperation with any state unless it is openly criminal on an international scale and cooperation is unnecessary. ✔ I will pursue an international policy that opens opportunities without prejudice and benefits Polish consumers. ✔ I want Poland to be a sovereign player on the world stage, not a pawn—and I understand this requires real military and economic strength. ✔ I will promote bilateral and international initiatives that strengthen Poland’s global role. ✔ I will appoint special ambassadors to finalize key Polish matters abroad, including exhumations of Polish genocide victims in Volhynia. ✔ I will declare persona non grata any foreign diplomat or activist harming Poland. ✗ I will strive to prevent Poland’s exclusion from important international processes or blocks to our participation in investigations—e.g., into Ukrainian responsibility for the Przewodów rocket strike or the Israeli shelling of a humanitarian convoy that killed a Pole. ✗ I will not make Poland dependent on any other state in any matter. ✗ I will not allow any state or organization to hinder Poland’s development of political and economic relations with others. ✗ I will not permit insults or humiliation of Poland or Poles internationally. ✗ I will use all available means to block war criminals from entering or staying in Poland.
EURO-COLLECTIVE ✔ I will pave the way for strengthening Poland’s influence internationally, including beyond the EU. ✔ I want to open paths for importing cheap raw materials for Polish producers and attractive exports for farmers, breeders, and processors. ✔ I will fight for fair treatment of Polish businesses abroad and respond appropriately at home to any access barriers. ✔ I will ensure diversification of energy-commodity supplies. ✗ I will try to block implementation of harmful EU directives and policies. ✗ I will not agree to any EU fines or taxes, including a home-heating tax. ✗ I oppose phasing out Polish extractive, energy, and fishing industries. ✗ I will prevent Poland’s dependence on a single direction of resource or technology supply. ✗ I will not let Germany decide on Polish ports—maritime or inland.
ORGANIZED CRIME, SECURITY SERVICES, SECRET SOCIETIES ✔ I will lead the fight against organized crime and political corruption. ✔ I will direct security services to protect Poles from foreign media giants manipulating public opinion. ✔ I want our intelligence services to provide effective counterintelligence protection for Polish projects and investments. ✔ I seek disclosure of the true circumstances of Blessed Fr. Jerzy Popiełuszko’s murder. ✔ I will make every effort to identify and punish those responsible for the deaths of Andrzej Lepper, Sławomir Petelicki, Gen. Marek Papała, and others. ✔ I will use legislative initiative to combat foreign agents’ undue influence in Poland. Anti-state activity must carry serious penalties. ✗ I will not support unjustified judicial surveillance of Poles, use of dispersed monitoring systems like Pegasus, or monitoring private correspondence and calls. ✗ I will not turn the state apparatus against its own citizens. ✗ Secret security services must not rule the state—I will prevent “state within a state” zones in any institution while defending services that safeguard Poland’s national interest.
NATION AND STATE ✔ I will defend the Polish nation against territorial disintegration, cultural substitution, and identity loss. I will not permit border blurring or separatist organizations. ✔ I favor concentrating—and not dispersing—centers of power and responsibility. ✔ I support strengthening the president’s authority; I believe strong popular electoral mandate should be reflected in the office’s competencies. ✔ I want Poland to respect its nation and citizens’ freedoms. ✔ No Pole—regardless of access to a computer or the Internet—may be discriminated against politically, socially, or economically for any reason. ✔ I will commission a state audit of finances, procedures, and structures, and appoint a special plenipotentiary for administrative reduction to build a strong minimal state. ✔ I will publish transparent, reliable data on the budget structure, bank profits, and money transfers abroad. ✔ I want an efficient Poland that reacts swiftly and decisively in crises. ✔ I pledge cooperation with any Polish political force guided by national—not foreign—interests. ✔ I will propose a statutory, and ultimately constitutional, rule that only exclusively Polish citizens may serve in public office, the military, police, security services, administration, or diplomacy. ✔ I will require candidates for public service to declare non-membership in any secret hierarchy (e.g., lodges, sects, mafias) that could create divided loyalties. ✔ I will initiate fast-track legal measures for Poles abroad to return home—including those from the Eastern Borderlands and displaced communities. ✔ I will invite the Polish diaspora to invest in, and return to, Poland. ✔ I will support and unite the diaspora, amplify their issues at home and abroad. ✔ I will pursue prosecution for anti-Polish acts—flag desecration, foreign flags at Polish institutions, etc. ✔ I will back initiatives showcasing Poland’s viewpoint and national interest internationally. ✔ I will support and endow prizes for activities promoting Polish culture and science. ✔ I believe natural and divine law are the highest legal sources and guarantors of legal stability and coherence. ✔ Hosting, with the Church, dignified commemorations of the 150th anniversary of the 1877 Gietrzwałd Marian apparitions will be a priority. ✗ I will not sign any law weakening any aspect of Polish security. ✗ I want to halt further shuffling of responsibility among anonymous officials behind overlapping institutions—as seen in the disastrous 2024 floods. ✗ I will do everything to stop foreign, corporate, or budgetary funding of anti-Polish or law-breaking foundations and organizations. ✗ I will oppose the state engaging in economic activity that competes unfairly with private entrepreneurs. ✗ I seek to limit abuse of “strategic enterprise” status. ✗ I oppose state-owned companies wherever strategic objectives can be met otherwise. ✗ I will not allow the state to provide services that citizens can themselves—subsidiarity—thus occupying areas where it need not. ✗ I will block funding for anti-Polish or anti-educational cultural or scientific ventures. ✗ I will challenge privilege-granting citizen-scoring systems, proliferating central registries, and data silos violating privacy—commercial, banking, or medical. ✗ I support ending state funding for political parties. ✗ I believe that full digitalization cannot justify extra demands on “analog” citizens. ✗ I will not agree to “Clean Transport Zones” that tax and discriminate against drivers; freedom of movement is a fundamental personal right.
IMMIGRATION ✔ I believe the inflow of immigrants must be stopped immediately. ✔ I will seek repatriation of illegal immigrants and foreigners committing crimes, helping them return to their permanent homes. ✔ I will do everything to secure Poland’s borders and enable proper protection by Border Guard officers. ✔ I will support any measures that defend public safety on Polish streets and prevent the violent phenomena by culturally foreign newcomers seen in many Western and Northern European countries from transferring here. ✗ I will not allow Poles to be marginalized in their own country. ✗ I will not sign a budget funding integration centers for immigrants. ✗ I will not sign a budget continuing the 800+ program for Ukrainians, pension supplements for foreigners, or any social benefits for non-citizens, especially those who crossed the border illegally. ✗ I will not bow to foreign pressures or “migration pacts.” ✗ I will halt “Ukrainization” of Poland and stop the “Banderization” of Polish statecraft.
COURTS ✔ I will propose solutions so first-instance rulings in simple cases occur within a week, and in complex cases within a month. ✔ I support electing judges and the creation of lay judges. ✔ I back a constitutional reset of the judiciary; where judges undermine each other, jurors should choose who decides. ✔ For public safety, I will seek harsh penalties for severe crimes, including capital punishment for premeditated murder, high treason, and desertion in face of the enemy. ✔ I will support every law that heals and streamlines the Polish court system. ✔ I favor radical simplification of laws. ✗ I will not allow further politicization of the judiciary. ✗ I will not permit EU interference in Polish courts. ✗ I will not tolerate blatant judicial injustice that turns victims into perpetrators and real perpetrators into victims. ✗ No criminal living abroad may sponsor serial lawsuits against Polish patriots. ✗ I will oppose any efforts to complicate or bloat legal provisions.
TRUTH ✔ I will restore awareness of historical truth’s importance. ✔ I will ensure Polish history and tradition occupy a proper place in national life, continuing the legacy of our great predecessors. ✔ I will support Catholic faith in social and political life as an immovable source of highest truths beyond parliamentary majorities’ reach. ✔ I see the necessity of the Coronation of Christ the King and its rightful understanding—not as coercion to religious practice, but as recognition of proper authority hierarchy, with man never supreme. ✔ I will propose special statutory and criminal protection for the Blessed Sacrament on Polish soil equivalent to that afforded to heads of state. ✔ I will do everything possible to ban Hanukkah celebrations in the Sejm, funding of the POLIN Museum, and extraterritoriality of the Auschwitz camp. ✔ I will strive for exhumations and thorough investigations in Jedwabne and other Polish sites of memory and martyrdom. ✔ I will defend freedom of speech and expression—even views contrary to big corporations’ interests. ✔ I believe truth should be legally protected; lies must not be propagated. ✔ I will appoint a special plenipotentiary for free speech, scientific research freedom, and public debate. ✗ I will denounce moral or emotional blackmail used for mass manipulation. ✗ I will not implement agendas that impoverish Poles or curb their civil liberties. ✗ I will oppose national alienation—cutting Poles from their history and identity. ✗ I will not allow history to be falsified to justify unlawful political or financial claims against Poland. ✗ I will block any German agenda that maligns Poles regarding World War II. ✗ I will not tolerate a status quo where media, polls, and preemptive corporate censorship enforce “political correctness” and manipulate elections. ✗ Media claiming neutrality yet shaping Polish public opinion may not distort reality via shadow-banning, deplatforming, opinion-blocking, or repressive fact-checks. ✗ I will oppose hatred-speech laws. ✗ I will not permit police repression of just protest. ✗ I oppose the RTV license fee and state-funded media.
